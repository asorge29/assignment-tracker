## Where did it come from?

I created this app to help me keep track of the ever-growing mound of schoolwork and for a fun learning project. I'm a student trying to gain experience, and will be maintaining and improving this app in my free time. I'd be pretty stoked if even a few people get some good use out of it and I'd love to hear from you have any feedback!
